Weather Forecast App

The weather forecast app uses Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and openweathermap.org/ APIs. The app allows the user to search for the current weather in the city of their choice; along with the five day forecast. The search is saved in localStorage if the user wishes to revisit the data. The app will reload the weather data for the last city searched when the app is reloaded or initially opened. The uv index is color coded to alert the user to the current intensity.
